# parallel-word-hunting-c
A parallel program written in C and uses OpenMP to search for words (from a file) in a random generated character matrix and prints the words whose characters were found in the matrix.

 *Note: If you use Visual Studio Community, you must enable OpenMP to run the program:
  **project->project's properties->Configuration properties->C/C++->Language->OpenMP support->Yes**
