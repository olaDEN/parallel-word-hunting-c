# parallel-word-hunting-c
A parallel program written in C and uses Open MP to search for words (from a file) in a random generated character matrix and prints the words whose characters were found in the matrix.

*Note: If you use Visual Studio Code, you must enable Open MP to run the program:
  **project->project's properties->Configuration properties->C/C++->Language->Open MP support->Yes**
